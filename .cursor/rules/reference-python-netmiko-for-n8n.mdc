# n8n Custom Node â€“ Netmiko Clone

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build a custom `n8n` node that mimics the behavior of the Python **Netmiko** library to interact with network devices over SSH. The node should support **multi-vendor** devices like Cisco, Juniper, Arista, etc.



## âœ… Key Features
- Language: **Node.js + TypeScript**
- Use **`ssh2`** Node.js library for SSH connections

## Reference code
- python netmiko reference code is available in folder: reference_python_netmiko
- Use it only for refernece.
- Our goal is to see its implementation and create n8n node accordingly.
